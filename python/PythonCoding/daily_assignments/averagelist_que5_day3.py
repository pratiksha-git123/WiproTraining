# Combining Built-in and User-Defined Functions:
# Find the Average of a List:
# Write a user-defined function average(numbers) that takes a list of numbers as an
# argument and returns the average of the numbers. Call the function with a list of
# numbers and print the average.

def average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
nums = list(map(int, input("Enter numbers: ").split()))
print("Average: ", average(nums))
